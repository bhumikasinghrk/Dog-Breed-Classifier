## Overview
This is a more reader-friendly version of a project I worked on as part of my Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree. The dataset for the model is available [here](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/).

## Data
The training data for this project is located here. This dataset contains 133 different breeds of dogs and is already split into train, test, and validation sets. Place the training, testing, and validation datasets in the dogImages folder.

## Instructions
If you want to run this code on your local computer, you'll also need to download the bottleneck features found here. I'll discuss what this is in the Jupyter Notebook, but it's a relatively large file so you may want to go ahead and start the download.

I recommend setting up an environment for this project to ensure you have the proper versions of the required libraries.

Note: You must navigate to the root folder of the project directory in order for the following commands to work properly.
